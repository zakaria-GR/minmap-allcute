Do you have what it takes to take on the role of Flash?Flash parkour will see you rush through a challenging parkour scene. You will need to use your speed and all your skills to conquer this card. Your speed will be tied to a bottle of extravaganza. Whenever you throw a bottle, you will be provided with insane speeds for a short period of time. This was done in order to prevent the player from moving insanely fast around the stage, which ultimately led to the fact that you did not have much control over yourself. This stage lasts approximately 15-30 minutes, depending on the skill level. There are many difficult areas just because of how difficult it is to jump accurately while being so fast. Good luck!"

Whenever you successfully complete a jump this system will randomly generate a new one for you, This means you can spend as long as you want jumping from block to block,There is an invisible armor stand that detects when a player is on the block, This then triggers a series of randomizer circuits. This determines where the next block will be placed. The block is placed and then the armor stand is put on the new block. Then the previous block is destroyed.In the future will add more possible jumps to make it more exciting, e.g. Ladders and Power-up blocks.There is also a scoreboard to count your number of successful jumps."

After all blocks except obsidian have been destroyed, the team with the remaining blocks wins. (except for command blocks too)."
